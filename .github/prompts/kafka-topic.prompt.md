# Set Up Kafka Topic and Consumer

Create a new Kafka topic configuration and consumer.

## Steps

1. Read existing NAIS manifest for Kafka pool configuration
2. Search codebase for existing Kafka consumer implementations to follow established patterns
3. Use Context7 to verify the Kafka library API used in this repo

## Checklist

- [ ] Add Kafka pool to NAIS manifest (if not already present)
- [ ] Create consumer class following existing patterns in the repo
- [ ] Define message payload and key types matching the topic schema
- [ ] Implement idempotent processing where needed
- [ ] Add error handling and logging consistent with existing consumers
- [ ] Add metrics (events processed counter, processing duration timer)
- [ ] Add structured logging with relevant identifiers
- [ ] Write tests following existing Kafka test patterns in the repo
